# Anti-Piracy Policy

## Our Position
**Manic EMU does not endorse or encourage piracy in any form.**  
This includes but is not limited to:

- Downloading or distributing copyrighted **ROMs, ISOs, or BIOS files** without legal ownership  
- Sharing or linking to websites or services that provide pirated game content  
- Bundling copyrighted game data in forks, builds, or redistributions of Manic EMU  

We strongly believe in supporting game developers, publishers, and the preservation of gaming history in a **legal and ethical manner**.

## What Is Allowed
- **Emulation itself is legal.**  
  Manic EMU provides an open-source emulator framework that can run software on iOS devices.  

- **Legally-owned backups.**  
  Users may play games they have legally purchased and dumped themselves.  
  - Physical media (cartridges, discs) → dump your own backups using appropriate tools.  
  - Digital purchases → extract data from your owned device/account.  

- **Homebrew & public domain content.**  
  We encourage the use of homebrew games, demos, and content that is released under open or permissive licenses.  

---

## What Is Not Allowed
- Requests for or distribution of copyrighted ROMs, ISOs, or BIOS files  
- Linking to piracy sites, torrents, or file-sharing services containing copyrighted content  
- Circumventing copyright protections on games you do not own  

Violations of this policy in community spaces (GitHub issues, discussions, Discord, etc.) may result in removal of posts, account bans, or reporting to platform administrators.

## Why This Matters
Emulation is a vital part of **video game preservation** and accessibility.  
However, piracy undermines the work of developers and risks the legal future of emulation projects like Manic EMU. By maintaining a strict anti-piracy stance, we ensure this project remains sustainable and respectful of intellectual property rights.

## Summary
- ✅ Emulation is legal  
- ✅ You may dump and use your own legally-owned games and BIOS files  
- ✅ Homebrew and public domain software are welcome  
- ❌ Piracy (downloading or sharing games/BIOS you do not own) is not permitted  

Thank you for supporting **Manic EMU** and helping us preserve gaming responsibly.
