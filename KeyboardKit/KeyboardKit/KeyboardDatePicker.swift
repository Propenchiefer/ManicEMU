/// A date picker that supports using hardware keyboard arrow keys to change the date.
///
/// The only supported style and mode combinations are:
///
/// - `UIDatePickerStyle.inline` and `UIDatePicker.Mode.date`
/// - `UIDatePickerStyle.inline` and `UIDatePicker.Mode.dateAndTime`
///
/// Key commands will not be available with any other style and mode combinations
/// such as using the `.wheels` style.
///
/// In these supported configurations, users can use the following key inputs when
/// the date picker is focused or is the first responder:
///
/// - Arrow keys to spatially change the selected day.
/// - Option + left/right arrow to change the month.
/// - Option + up/down arrow to change the year.
/// - Command + T to jump to today.
///
/// Actions that would set the date outside the range of `minimumDate` to `maximumDate`
/// will not be handled, leaving these key inputs able to be handled by objects
/// further along the responder chain.
///
/// All calendars with identifiers provided by Foundation are supported, including
/// Gregorian, Buddhist, Chinese etc. Inputs are flipped for right-to-left layouts.
///
/// In a supported configurations, `KeyboardDatePicker` will be focusable as part of the
/// tab loop. Since it uses arrow key inputs, it gives itself a unique focus group
/// identifier. The `focusEffect` is set to a rounded `UIFocusHaloEffect` by default.
