import UIKit

/// A navigation controller that supports using a hardware keyboard to navigate back using ⌘ + `[` or
/// ⌘ + ← (mirrored for right-to-left layouts) and triggering the actions of the bar button items in
/// the navigation bar and toolbar.
///
/// Bar button items must be instances of `KeyboardBarButtonItem` to support keyboard equivalents, even
/// for system items (because otherwise there is no way to know the system item after initialisation).
///
/// From iOS 15, `UINavigationController` itself provides a ⌘  + `[` key command to go back, but
/// the UIKit implementation doesn’t correctly handle nested navigation controllers which is common
/// when `UISplitViewController` collapses. Therefore `KeyboardNavigationController` will remove
/// this key command from the superclass and adds in its own commands.
///
/// The concept for this class was originally developed for [PSPDFKit]( https://pspdfkit.com/ ).
