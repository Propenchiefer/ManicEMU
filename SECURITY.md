## 🔒 Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security issues seriously.  
If you discover a vulnerability or potential exploit in Manic EMU:

1. **Do not** disclose it publicly.  
2. Email the maintainers directly at: **[mafty.manicemu@gmail.com](mailto: mafty.manicemu@gmail.com)**  
   *(Replace with your project’s actual contact email.)*  
3. Provide detailed information, including:
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Impact assessment (what could an attacker do?)
   - Affected environment (iOS version, device, build settings)
4. We will acknowledge receipt within **7 days** and provide a timeline for remediation.

## 🔐 Scope of Security Concerns

We are especially interested in reports related to:
- Arbitrary code execution or sandbox escape
- Remote code execution (e.g., via network features such as GCDWebServer)
- Privilege escalation or unauthorized access
- Sensitive data leaks (user saves, iCloud data, personal information)

---

## ✅ Out of Scope

The following are generally not considered security issues:
- Crashes caused by invalid ROMs, BIOS files, or malformed save states
- Bugs that require jailbroken or heavily modified devices
- Non-security related emulator inaccuracies (e.g., graphical glitches, timing issues)

---

## 🤝 Responsible Disclosure

Please follow responsible disclosure practices:
- Do not publicly share exploits before we have addressed them.
- Give us a reasonable timeframe (typically 90 days) to patch the issue.
- We will credit security researchers in release notes if desired.
